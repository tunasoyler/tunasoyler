### Hello, I'm Tunahan.
  
  As a .NET developer, I have worked on various projects and have been actively involved on Github to enhance my skills.

  My latest project, "BurgerMVC" is a web application:
  - Built using Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
  - The application allows users to add items to their cart and place an order.
  - The AI chat feature suggests personalized recommendations based on the user's preferences.
  - The application is built on a layered architecture, with a presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer, providing scalability and maintainability.
  - The codebase follows SOLID principles and has been thoroughly tested to ensure stability and reliability.
  
  I have been active on Github for approximately 1 years, contributing to various projects. Additionally, I seek inspiration from the Github community to enhance my projects with new features.
